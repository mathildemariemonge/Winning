We two as Mathilde and Ilkay are going to win the Euromillions lottery with a machine learning model. We will train the model with the past years winner numbers and predict the possibility of winning depending on frequency of numbers. The data is from Kaggle.com and it includes 1318 rows and 10 columns. 

Day1: We are going to analyse the existing dataset to detect trends in past winning patterns.
We will look at frequency of numbers, winning pairs and amount gained. 


Day2: We will built a data visualisation deck for the analysis of past data. 

Day3: We will scale our dataset to a standard range so that the performance of the machine learning algorithm improves

Day4: In the fourth day, we will split our dataset, and train our model.
